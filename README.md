- 👋 Hi, I’m @Thyodin
- 👀 I’m interested in open source home automation using Raspberry Pi and Arduino microcontrollers and sensors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning robotics, as well as newer tools like Github and Docker.
- 💞️ I’m a single dad with 2 boys so I don't have a ton of free time to collaborate, but interested in garden automation using open source components.
- 📫 How to reach me... it feels like a trap to put my primary contact information in plaintext for anybody to see (or scrape)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I just learned to solder (I'm 42) having somehow made it through engineering school without ever learning. Thanks breadboards!
